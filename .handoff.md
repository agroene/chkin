# Chkin — Handoff Summary

## Session Summary (Last Updated: 2024-12-10)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **MVP Analysis** — Comprehensive reverse-engineering of www.chkin.co.za documented in `docs/mvp-analysis.md`
2. **Tech Stack Decision** — Next.js 16 + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma + Tailwind
3. **Project Scaffolding** — Complete app structure with three-portal architecture
4. **GitHub Setup** — Repository created at https://github.com/agroene/chkin

### Current State
- App scaffolding complete and building successfully
- Three route groups: `/patient`, `/provider`, `/admin`
- PostgreSQL + Prisma configured (schema empty)
- Docker ready for deployment

### Next Session: Authentication
Evaluate open source auth providers:
- Better Auth
- Auth.js (NextAuth)
- Keycloak
- Supabase Auth

Requirements:
- Multi-tenant support
- Role-based access (admin, provider staff, provider admin)
- Audit logging for POPIA compliance
- Self-hosted option preferred
- No custom auth code

### Key Files
- `CLAUDE.md` — Main context file (updated)
